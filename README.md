I have created a Configurable Weather Dashboard with TypeScript and MUI.
The user should be able to add.and remove a weather widget.
Dashboard Layout:

Use Material-Ul's Grid or Box components to arrange widgets in the dashboard.
Implement an "Add Widget" button using MUI's Button component to allow users to add a weather widget.
Provide an option to remove the weather widget from the dashboard using an MUI IconButton.

Include basic information such as temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy), and an icon representing the weather.
Use React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks with TypeScript for managing and persisting the dashboard's state.

Here is how Weather dashboard looks like.
